Overview
The New York Citi Bike program is the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. The main objective of this project is to generate regular reports for city officials to help promote and enhance the program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has established a reliable infrastructure for capturing data on the program's usage. Every month, bike data is collected, organized, and made available on the Citi Bike Data webpage. However, while the data is consistently updated, the team has yet to develop a dashboard or a sophisticated reporting system. As a result, city officials have inquiries about the program, and the first task is to create a set of data reports that can provide the necessary answers.
